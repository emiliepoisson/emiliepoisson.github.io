- Hi, Iâ€™m @emiliepoisson - french doctor engineer with [HDR since 2020](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03059280).
- Iâ€™m assistant professor and interested in data science and machine learning in the university of Littoral (ULCO). 
- Iâ€™m involved in [JERICO Project](https://www.jerico-ri.eu/) to propose new algorithm to extract information from marine measurement instruments.
